// A minimal implementation of wc -c [1], which counts the number of bytes in an
// input stream. (This is a toy example: fs.stat [2] would be much, much faster
// for normal files, though this approach is still useful for streaming inputs
// like stdin.)

// Since `flow` is only called after the reader is filled, reader.read is
// guaranteed to return non-null when the reader has not yet ended. And since
// reader.read is called with no length argument, it is guaranteed to return
// null when the reader has ended.
